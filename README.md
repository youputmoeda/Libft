>*"Your very first own library"*



The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual fuctions that you'll be allowed to use in all your other projects.


It is forbidden to use global variables. If subfuctions are needed, they must be "static". The library must be compiled with ar command (libtool is forbidden).
